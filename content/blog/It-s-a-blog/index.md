So it begins. I am starting to blog. <!-- more -->I recently quit my job and will start freelancing very soon (hire me :P). There were and still are way too many projects on my virtual todo list (not even mentioning technologies to evaluate). I have one month of spare time now and will finally attack this nasty list and post some of the results here. How many posts will there be? One, two, three? Will it last longer than 3 weeks? The journey begins :S:S:S:S

It will be exciting :O
