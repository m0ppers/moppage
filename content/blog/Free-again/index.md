I had 2 mostly enjoyable years at ArangoDB working as a C++ developer but I finally decided to be my own boss again.

I am open for new interesting projects starting March 2018. So far I will try to stay local (Cologne area) but in case there is an interesting travel/remote opportunity - who knows :)

If you have an interesting project involving a few or all of these bullet points be sure to reach out (andreas -at- mop dot koeln):

- ReactJS
- CI systems
- Release tooling
- DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Rust
- node.js
- Javascript
